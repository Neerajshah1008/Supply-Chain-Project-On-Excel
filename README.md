# Supply-Chain-Project-On-Excel
ðŸ”¹This project automates inventory allocation for major B2B channels using a centralized Excel-based solution.

ðŸ”¹All referenced files and data points were consolidated to develop this system, enabling smart and efficient allocation logic without manual intervention.

ðŸ”¹The model ensures that B2B inventory is allocated optimally without overcommitting, preserving inventory margins for D2C salesâ€”which contribute the majority of profit.

ðŸ”¹D2C daily run rate (DRR) and safety stock levels are tracked in the same sheet, ensuring that D2C needs are prioritized during allocation.

ðŸ”¹Discontinued products are automatically flagged and excluded from B2B allocations to prevent stock wastage or compliance issues.

ðŸ”¹The system pulls inventory availability from all three warehouses (BLR, GGR, MUM) for each PO simultaneously (BU to BW), ensuring maximum allocation coverage.

ðŸ”¹Excess inventory is identified dynamically, making it easy to redirect surplus stock to B2B partners in a controlled manner.
